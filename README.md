## Project: Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project implements **Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm**, a classic graph algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

### Key Features:
- Uses a **priority queue (min-heap)** for efficient selection of the next vertex with the smallest tentative distance.
- Represents the graph as an adjacency dictionary for flexible input.
- Calculates the shortest distance to each node from a specified start node.
- Demonstrates usage with a sample graph and prints the shortest distances.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python dijkstra.py
