# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Implementations

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Python and Java. These projects are designed to help with learning, practicing coding skills, and preparing for technical interviews.

## Projects Included

### 1. Edmond’s Algorithm (Java)
- Implementation of Edmond’s algorithm to find the **Minimum Arborescence** (minimum spanning tree for directed graphs) rooted at a specified vertex.
- Uses a modified Bellman-Ford algorithm and supports input from a file.
- Detects negative weight cycles and outputs edges in the minimum arborescence with the total weight.

### 2. Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Python)
- Finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.
- Utilizes a priority queue (min-heap) for efficient vertex selection.
- Graph represented as an adjacency dictionary.

### 3. Binary Search Tree (Python)
- Implements a classic binary search tree with insertion, search, and traversal functionalities.
- Demonstrates efficient data storage and retrieval.

### 4. Depth First Search (DFS) (Python)
- Recursive and iterative DFS traversal of graphs.
- Useful for graph exploration and solving connectivity problems.

### 5. Merge Sort (Python)
- Classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with O(n log n) complexity.
- Efficiently sorts an unsorted list.

### 6. Quick Sort (Python)
- Efficient in-place sorting algorithm using divide-and-conquer strategy.
- Often faster than merge sort in practical scenarios.
